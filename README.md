## Toolbox
### Availability:
- [x] Yield to Maturity (YTM)
- [x] Present Value (PV)
- [x] Future Value (FV)
- [x] Number of Periods (N)
- [x] Swap Rate (swap_rate)
- [x] Interest rate models: KWF branch

### Methodologies
- YTM and swap rate are determined using the Newton-Raphson method.
- KWF branch returns the larger analytical solution.

## Other Notebooks
Simple demo of concepts/models in Baxter & Rennie (1996).  At present, the binomial approach to model discrete process is included.

## TODO
- Test cases
- Demo for modelling continuous time processes
- Interest rate models
