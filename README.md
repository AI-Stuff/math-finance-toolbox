## Toolbox
Contains python implementation of some frequently-used bond pricing functions:
- Yield to Maturity (YTM)
- Present Value (PV)
- Future Value (FV)
- Number of Periods (N)
- Swap Rate (swap_rate)

In particular, YTM and swap rate are determined using the Newton-Raphson method.

## Other Notebooks
Simple demo of concepts/models in Baxter & Rennie (1996).  At present, the binomial approach to model discrete process is included.

## TODO
- Test cases
- Demo for modelling continuous time processes
- Interest rate models
